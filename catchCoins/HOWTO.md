How to build your Catch Coins game
==================================

With a Shield
-------------

That's the easy way, just get a shield like [this one](http://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php?title=Arduino_LCD_KeyPad_Shield_(SKU:_DFR0009))

Then solder your LCD on it (the code is for a 2 lines LCD screen)

You can add buzzer, tilt sensor, IR & leds on the pins you wish, as long as it works!
