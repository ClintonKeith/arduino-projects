Aim

In this game, you have to catch the coins that appear randomly on the screen.
Beware, some monsters might try to steal them from you!

Hardware
--------

* Arduino Board (Tested with Arduino Uno)
* LCD screen (sized 16x2)

I also used [this shield](http://www.dfrobot.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=123_124&product_id=51) to connect the screen to the board.

Software
--------

* [LiquidCrystal](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/LiquidCrystal) library
